c = chores
f = frequency of chore (time unit to be determined)
w = chore weight
t = time to complete chore
b = budget (time)
p = person(s)


given n chores, where each chore is a assigned t time as the expected value of completion and f for frequency of chore, do the best possible distribution of chores based on b budget, sorted by weight
